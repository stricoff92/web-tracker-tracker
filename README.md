## What is Web Tracker Tracker

> WT&sup2; is a chrome extension that monitors hosts and data being transfered via URL parameters, request bodies, response bodies, and certain headers including cookies. After browsing several sites for several minutes the extension will show which 3rd party hosts your browser has talked to as well as cross examine the unique identifiers sent and received between the browser and the various 3rd party hosts.

> The investigation board visualizes unique identifiers that are shared between 3rd party hosts as well as drill down into the specific that was shared.
